    <h2>About Page</h2>
    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in
                his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug,
                in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle
                of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's
                East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on
                the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850, after his father went missing and died in the
                dungeons of Dol Guldur.

            <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also
                nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing
                feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching.
                It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.
                <br>
                <br>
                With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking
                Thranduil. They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they
                reached Lake-town. The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by
                the river.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin
                and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin.
                <br>
                <br>
                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
                company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the
                group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
                with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin
                and younger brother of Óin.
                <br>
                <br>
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of
                the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
                <br>
                <br>
                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
                March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin
                to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin
                referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling
                distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger
                brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely
                Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the
                Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA
                2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely
                Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
                younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin
                accompanied Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
                <br>
                <br>
                Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left
                the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In
                TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood
                from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin
                to inform him the news.

                Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori
                and Nori. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin,
                Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the
                death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five
                Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.

                <br>
                Before the Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and
                Ori. In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling
                with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

                Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with

                Bifur was a Dwarf of the late-Third Age. He is best known for being a companion to Bilbo Baggins and

                Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not related to the royal House of
                Durin. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He
                and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced
                to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a
                new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

                Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown,
                though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of
                the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli
                was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the
                quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the
                loss of Thráin II.

                Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in
                The Lord of the Rings.
                <br>
                <br>
                Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of
                Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One
                Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his
                adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo
                Baggins to be his heir after his parents, Drogo and Primula, drowned in the Brandywine River.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and one of the few to set foot in the

            <h3>Gandalf</h3>
            <p>
                Gandalf, known temporarily as the Grey and later the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya), was an
                Istar (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined
                Thorin II Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the
                Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the
                War of the Ring.
                <br>
                <br>
                Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar before
                the Music of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä. In
                his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with
                light and fire, much like Varda, yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and
                patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them
                fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of
                Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him
                out of despair.
